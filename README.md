# Proj0-Hello
Trivial project to exercise version control, turn-in, and other
mechanisms.

Instructions:

- Replace these instructions with a proper README including the
   author, contact address, and a brief description of what the
   software does.

- Modify the program "hello.py" so that it prints "Hello world".
(Nothing more and nothing less.)

- Test your program locally;  revise and re-test as needed.  (How long
can it take, really?)

- Copy the credentials-skel.py file to credentials.py and fill in
appropriately.

- Commit your changes.  You will need to use "git add" on
your files hello.py and README.md, but *not* on credentials.py,
because that file does not belong on github.  (In later projects it
will contain confidential information, like access keys and
passwords for web services.)  Your changes must be "pushed"
to your public repository on github so that the auto-checker
can "clone" them back to the grading machine.

- Test your code with the auto-checker.  Revise and push changes
as needed.

- Turn in with Canvas.  The file you turn in is credentials.ini.  We
use the repository link in your credentials.ini to access the rest,
just like the auto-checker.
